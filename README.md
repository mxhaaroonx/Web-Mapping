# Delhi Metro Map and Global Population Visualization

This project visualizes the Delhi Metro stations and global population data using Folium, a powerful Python library for creating interactive maps. The project involves the use of geographical data to create a map that displays metro stations in Delhi with color-coded markers based on their metro lines. Additionally, it includes a layer that visualizes the population of different countries around the world.
